# Computer Store

The project follows the guidelines provided in the Noroff assignment and includes the minimum requirements as described in the Appendix A-B.

This is a dynamic webpage built using "vanilla" JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is designed to simulate a computer store where you can buy laptops, take out loans from a bank, and work to earn money.



## Features

The Komputer Store includes the following minimum requirements:

The Bank: This area allows you to store funds and make bank loans. It displays your bank balance, outstanding loan (if any), and has a button to get a loan.

Work: This area allows you to increase your earnings and deposit cash into your bank balance and pay back your loans (if you have it). It has a button to work, and a button to transfer your earnings to the bank or to pay back your loan.

Laptops: This area allows you to select and display information about the laptops available for purchase. It displays a dropdown menu of available laptops, and when a laptop is selected, it displays the laptop's image, name, description, price, and specs.

The laptops available for purchase are provided via a provided by Noroff API that returns JSON data. The endpoint for the API is https://hickory-quilled-actress.glitch.me/computers.
